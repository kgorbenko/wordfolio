# Project Guidelines

- Coding guidelines
  - Use command `dotnet fantomas .` to format code.
  - Variable names should be descriptive.
  - Prefer short variable names, but keep them descriptive.
  - Avoid abbreviations in variable and type names.
  - Do not write comments.
  - Prefer using `open` statements instead of referencing namespaces explicitly.
  - F#
    - Prefer modules and functions, small files grouped by responsibility.
    - Use explicit types for public APIs. Keep pipelines readable.
    - unused `open` statements should be removed.
    - `open` statements should be sorted:
      - System imports should go first.
      - trird party imports should go second.
      - local imports should go last.
      - different groups of imports should be separated by a blank line.
      - imports should be sorted alphabetically within each group.
  - csproj|fsproj
    - Use double spaces for indentation.
    - `PropertyGroup`s and `ItemGroup`s should be separated by a blank line.
